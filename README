AutoNoLayout
============

Requests with the format of :partial will now render with no layout
The format will be adjusted back to :html so that your html views will be rendered even when the :partial format is specified

Two things you will need to do to take advantage of this plugin:
  
  1. add :format => :partial to links that you want to open in a modal
  
    Example: new_user_session_path(:format => :partial)
    
  2. Setup some sort of modal javascript library and make it open for links that end with .partial

    Here is an example using jQuery and Boxy:

      $('[href$=.partial]').boxy();

  3. Profit
